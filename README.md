# BiasGuard News

This is our final project for Applied AI - a news platform that helps readers identify political bias in articles.

## What it does

The app analyzes news articles using AI to detect bias and generate neutral summaries. It pulls from different news sources across the political spectrum so you can see multiple perspectives on the same story.

## Getting started

Everything you need is in the `news-platform` folder. Check out the README there for setup instructions.

Quick version:
- Install Node.js
- Get an OpenAI API key
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`

That's pretty much it.

## About

Group 7's final project for Applied AI course. We wanted to build something that actually helps people understand the news better instead of just staying in their echo chamber.
